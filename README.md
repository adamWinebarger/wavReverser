## A couple of notes:

- I've been putting #include statements in the headers for their respective C files mostly because KDEvelop needs those to execute. I typically comment those out before my commits. But if you're getting multiple definition errors in gcc then check the header file for those include statements.
- I think that's all I've got for now.
